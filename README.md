# FreeCodeCamp New Coders Survey Visualization

This repository is for visualizing FreeCodeCamp's New Coders Survey data, using D3.js.

Survey data currently available for years - 2016, 2017.

*=> currently testing csv-parsing of included csv file, alternative is to upload local map.json file*

*=> remove map.json and json-parser.js if retaining the csv-parsing approach*
